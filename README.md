The following document describes some best practices, general wisdom, and various resources for teaching online courses for the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

- If you have additional information you would like added, please submit a pull request, create an issue, or just [email David Dalpiaz](mailto:dalpiaz2@illinois.edu).
- This document can be accessed at https://go.illinois.edu/stat-online

This document is now, and will likely always be a work in progress.

## General Wisdom

- Organization! + Communication! + Engagement!
- [Don't panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic)
- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- [Perfect is the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)
- You're probably already 50% of the way there.
- Ask questions!
  - Stop by the Teaching Support Group meetings!
  - Jump on [Slack](https://uiucstats.slack.com/archives/GNXPYSBL3) and ask a quick question!

## Quick Start

- [ ] Do you have the necessary computer hardware, software, and internet connection?
- [ ] Is your class in a Learning Management System?
- [ ] Can you distribute files to students?
- [ ] Do students have the ability to submit assignments to you?
- [ ] Are you able to make announcements to your (up-to-date) class roster?
- [ ] Can your students communicate with you? With each other?
- [ ] Do you have a system for creating and distributing asynchronous video lectures?
- [ ] Do you have a system for synchronous office hours and other meetings?
- [ ] Do you have an assignment strategy?
- [ ] Do you have a plan for administering identity verified assignments?

## Hardware

In addition to access to a computer and an internet connection, you will need to be able to:

- Listen to audio
- Record audio
- Record video

Hardware components that may be necessary:

- Laptop (or desktop)
  - [ATLAS Share](https://atlas.illinois.edu/student-information/atlas-share)
- iPad or Tablet
  - Department Surface Tablets are available
- High-speed internet connection
- Webcam
  - [Example: Logitech C920 PRO](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920)
- Microphone (could be built into webcam)
  - [Example: Tonor TC-777](https://www.tonormic.com/products/tonor-tc-777-usb-microphone)
- Headphones
	- Ever been annoyed by background noise in a web meeting?
	- Otherwise, speakers
- Document camera
  - [Example: Longjoy LV-1010](http://www.longjoytech.com/lv-1010.html)

If in need of hardware that you do not currently have, contact Melissa.

## Software

### Key Software

In addition to an LMS (and Piazza if your chosen LMS does not have a forum), a course could probably be taken online with only these three tools.

- [Illinois Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/)
  - Web conferencing software.
  - University wide "Pro" license.
  - Generally user friendly.
- [Illinois Media Space](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/)
  - A YouTube-like service maintained by the University.
  - Include a built-in web-based recording tool.
- [Illinois Box](https://box.illinois.edu/)
   - Free unlimited storage!
   - Web interface and desktop apps.
   - Naive version control.
   - Does not require VPN.

### Additional Software

This list is far from exhaustive and should grow over time.

- [UIUC VPN](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn/download-and-set-up-the-vpn-client)
  - Avoid if possible. For example, use Box instead of the network drive.
- [Remote Desktop](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=47684)
  - Generally requires a VPN.
- [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/)
  - Excellent app for notes and annotation on iPad
- [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/)
  - Excellent quizzing tool developed at UIUC.
- [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)
  - Simple video recording and editing.
- TODO: Slack
- [Discord](https://discord.com/)
  - A messaging platform particular popular among computer game players.
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
  - Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.
  - Like Discord, OBS is popular among those who stream computer game play, giving it a large user base.
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
- [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)
- TODO: ffmpeg

## Learning Management Systems

- Compass (Blackboard)
- Canvas
- Moodle
- Others

## Course Communications

Since you won't be seeing your students three times a week, alternative communication methods become extremely important.

- Weekly announcements!
  - Introduce week's topics, note deadlines.
  - Roster access? Copy to student email!
    - Via LMS automatic rosters
    - Via [DMI](http://dmi.illinois.edu/)
    - Via [Self-Serice](https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/)
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/)
  - Highly recommended!
  - Encourage posting on Piazza to reduce email.

## Office Hours

Zoom will likely be the key to holding online office hours.

- [Illinois Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/)
  - Be sure to use this link to create and use your account. Free accounts do not have the same capacities.
  - Be aware of [general settings](https://illinois.zoom.us/profile/setting) and meeting settings.
    - Consider disabling email notifications when users join.
    - Consider enabling "Mute participants upon entry."
  - Be aware of Screen Sharing and "Whiteboard."
  - As "host" you have the ability to mute other users. Use this!
  - Can be recorded.

## "Lecture"

- Synchronous versus Asynchronous?
  - Don't be afraid of asynchronous
  - Use Zoom for synchronous. But this is strongly discouraged, especially for "large" classes.
    - "Any synchronous course sessions (such as Zoom, Skype for Business, Blackboard Collaborate) must be held during regularly scheduled class times."
    - "Do not use Zoom for classes of greater than 150 students. Use video, audio or text options for lecture delivery whenever possible."

## Video Recording

- [Illinois Media Space: Express Capture](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/recorder/index/record)
- [Illinois Media Space: Kaltura Capture Desktop Recorder](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/kalturacapture/launch/create)
- [Illinois Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/)
- [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)
- [Windows 10: Screen Recorder](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10)
- [OSX: Screen Recorder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721)
- [iOS: Screen Recorder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935)

Many of these options have some simple editing tools built in. Generally, it is probably best to not worry too much about editing. As long as the content exists, that's a win.

## Video Distribution

- [Illinois Media Space](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/)
  - A YouTube-like service maintained by the University.
- [Illinois Box](https://box.illinois.edu/)
  - Store videos in Box. Linking to the video will allow the video to be played in a web browser.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
  - Potentially inaccessible in China. Technically not recommended. Could be used as a backup to Illini Media Space.

Be aware of closed captioning. You may have received an email from DRES noting that you have a student that requires captioning. YouTube does auto-captioning fairly well. [Kaltura](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_rjko9fw3/33192941) also has auto-captioning abilities now.

## Exams

Securely administering exams online is extremely difficult. This is a topic that will need to be given thought. Unless you are already using a quizzing tool such as [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) or LON-CAPA, it would probably be very difficult to transition quickly. Even with these tools, proctoring will be an issue. We may need to relax some of our expectations around security of exams.

- [Illinois ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/portal/illinois)
  - Note: The Provost will be prohibiting additional fees incurred by students. (More information to come on this. As of 3/13, this is official, with a specific mention of proctoring services.)
- Zoom "Manual Proctoring"
- Make alternative assessments!
- ???

## Miscelaneous Best Practices

- Short versus long videos.
  - Pros and cons to both, but engaging videos are what really matters.
  - Be yourself! Make mistakes!
- Course organization: Week or modular structure.
- Clear messaging is necessary, especially for assignments and deadlines.
- **Instructor presence is critical.** (answer questions on piazza!)
